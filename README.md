## ðŸš€ Deployment

### > Frontend on Netlify

Our sleek frontend, crafted with React.js, is deployed on Netlify, offering lightning-fast loading times and a secure browsing experience. Netlify's global CDN ensures that players and organizers can access our application from anywhere, without any lag or downtime.

### > Backend on Heroku

The robust backend, built with Node.js and Express.js, resides on Heroku. This cloud platform as a service enables us to manage our application's server-side logic and database interactions seamlessly. Heroku's powerful dynos ensure that our backend is always up and running, ready to handle requests from our users efficiently.

### > Authentication with Auth0

Security is our top priority. We have integrated Auth0 for authentication to provide a secure and hassle-free sign-in process. Auth0's advanced security features ensure that only registered players can access their profiles, join games, or view sensitive information, keeping our platform safe from unauthorized access.
